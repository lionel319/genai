soscmd co - check out files and directories
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd co [-C]
              [-a<attrname>=<attrvalue>]
              [-b<branchname>]
              [-Nlock]
              [-Novr]
	      [-q]
              [select options]
              [pathnames]

DESCRIPTION
    Checks out for editing the selected files and directories.
    Only the latest revision on any branch may be checked out.

    A check out lock is placed on the revision which keeps 
    others from checking out the same revision of the file. 
    When a file is checked out, write permissions are given
    to the file in your workarea and you can now edit it.

ARGUMENTS
    -C
        Enable concurrent checkout.
        If you have this option then you will be able to checkout
        a file even if someone else already has the same revision
        checked out.

    -a<attrname>=<attrvalue>
        This option is used to specify values to attributes
        with this command.
        The attribute name and value are separated by the '='
        character with no spaces in between.
        The attribute name and value must immediately
        follow this option with no spaces.
        If the attribute value has spaces then you must enclose
        the value in double quotes '"'.

        Attribute names may be abbreviated provided there is no
        ambiguity.

    -b<branchname>
        If this option is used then the latest revision on the
        given branch is checked out. If the branch does not
        exist on the file then a branch is created. 

    -Nlock
        Checkout without placing a lock on the file.
        You should use this option carefully because other
        users can edit the file since you have not locked it.
        It can be used when the client is unable to connect to
        the primary server due to network or other issues.
        It may also be used when you want to make some temporary
        modifications to the file that you plan to discard later.

    -Novr
        Do not overwrite modified file in the workarea.
        You should use this option if the file in the workarea
        has been modified without checking it out. SOS will not
        restore the original file from the server.
    -q
        Quiet or non-verbose  mode. Do not print per object checked out  status message. Only
        command summary is printed along with the checked out  object count. 

    [select options] pathnames
        These are selection options.
        Refer to help for the 'select' command.

        The selections in the SOS window will change to the
        selection specified by these options.

        If no selection option or pathnames are provided then
        the command will be performed on the current selections
        in the SOS window.

NOTES
    If the 'change_summary' attribute in not specified but the 
    'Log' attribute is provided  then the same value is also 
    used for the 'change_summary'.

    If a file to be checked out already has write permissions in
    your workarea then that file is renamed by adding a '.SVM'
    extension before checking out the file from the project.
    A warning message is also issued to alert you.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd co
        Check out all files and directories which are currently
        selected in the SOS window.

        current working directory.

    soscmd co adder.vhd/main
        Check out the latest revision of 'adder.vhd' on the main
        development branch.

    soscmd co -C adder.vhd/main
        Check out the latest revision of 'adder.vhd' on the main
        development branch even if someone else also has it
        checked out.

    soscmd co .
        Check out the current directory.

    soscmd co -achange_summary="Instantiate adder." top.vhd
        Check out 'top.vhd' and assign the 'change_summary'
        attribute the value:
            Instantiate adder.

    soscmd co -snm -aLog="Merge the 'rel1_fix' branch to main."
        Check out all files which have unmerged branches and
        assign the 'Log' attribute the value:
          Merge the 'rel1_fix' branch to main.

    soscmd co -snm -achange_summary="Merge rel1_fix" \
              -aLog="Merge the 'rel1_fix' branch to main."
        Check out all files which have unmerged branches and
        assign the 'Log' attribute the value:
            Merge the 'rel1_fix' branch to main.
        and the 'change_summary' attribute the value:
            Merge rel1_fix

    soscmd co -bmain testbench.v
        Checkout the latest revision of 'testbench.v' on the 
        main line of development.

    soscmd co -bbugfix top.v/5
