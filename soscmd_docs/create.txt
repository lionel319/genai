----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd create [-a<attrname>=<attrvalue>]
           [-prj<ref_proj_name> [-d<ref_parent_dir>] [-cd<ref_parent_dir>] [-q]]
           [pathnames]

DESCRIPTION
    Adds the specified files and directories in the workarea
    to the project and places them under SOS control.

    Selected objects are created in the project repository and the 
    current object in the workarea is checked in and the first 
    revision of the object is created.

ARGUMENTS
    -a<attrname>=<attrvalue>
        This option is used to specify values to attributes
        with this command.
        The attribute name and value are separated by the '='
        character with no spaces in between.
        The attribute name and value must immediately
        follow this option with no spaces.
        If the attribute value has spaces then you must enclose
        the value in double quotes '"'.

        Attribute names may be abbreviated provided there is no
        ambiguity.

    -prj<ref_proj_name>
        Create the objects in the given reference project. These
        objects get added as a reference in the primary project.
        This option is Not required if the parent of the object
        already belongs to the reference project.

    -d<ref_parent_dir>
        Create the objects in the reference project under
        the path specified by <ref_parent_dir>. If the path
        does not exist, sos will generate an error.

    -cd<ref_parent_dir>
        Create the objects in the reference project under
        the path specified by <ref_parent_dir>. If the path
        does not exist, it will be created in the reference project.
     -q
        Quiet or non-verbose  mode. Do not print create status per
	object. Only command summary is printed along with the created
	object count. 

    [select options] pathnames
        These are selection options.
        Refer to help for the 'select' command.

        The selections in the SOS window will change to the
        selection specified by these options.

        If no selection option or pathnames are provided then
        the command will be performed on the current selections
        in the SOS window.

        Names of 'temporary' files and directories in the
        workarea to be placed under SOS control.

    For setting file access control following three attributes
    can be used.
        1) Owner                to define the ownership of the file/dir
        2) ReadAccess           to set read access permissions
        3) WriteAccess          to set write access permissions

NOTES
    The files and directories must already exist in the workarea
    before they can be placed under SOS control using this 
    command.

    The access control attribute names are case sensitive.

    Owner can have any string value.

    ReadAccess and WriteAccess can have only the following
    three values  (all lower case only)
         o owner            Only the owner has access.
         o group            All admins and members of the
                            group or groups the owner belongs
                            to, have access.
                            To define groups please refer to
                            server configuration file "sosd.cfg".
         o world            Any one can have access.

    Options -prj and -d go together, so both must be present to create
    an object in a reference project.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd create -aDescription="Stimulus file for testbench" stim.dat
        Add the file 'stim.dat' to the project with the
        given description.

    soscmd create pci pci/*.v
        Add the directory 'pci' and all the files with the 
        '.v' extension in it into the project. Make sure to
        check in the directory 'pci' after you are done
        'creating' files and dirs under it.

    soscmd create -aRCPgm=gzip_copy -aIcon=Waveform full.sdf
        Add the file 'full.sdf' to the project but use the
        'gzip_copy' method to keep the revisions of this file.
        Since SDF files are generated and are completely 
        different in each revision it is better to compress
        and store each revision rather than use RCS.
        Also use the 'Waveform' icon for this file instead of
        the generic file icon.

    soscmd create -aRCPgm=file_copy -aIcon=Waveform full.sdf
        Add the file 'full.sdf' to the project but use the
        'file_copy' method to keep the revisions of this file.
        This is another method to store revisions in the repository
        if you do not want to compress/uncompress files nor use RCS.
        This method stores each revision as a separate file.

    soscmd create -aOwner="user1" mult.v
        Add file mult.v with owner as "user1".
        
    soscmd create -aReadAccess="world" mult.v
        Add file mult.v with read access permissions to any user.
        
    soscmd create -aGroup="sos_dev_grp" -aWriteAccess="group" mult.v
        Add file mult.v with write access permissions to group and
        group to sos_dev_grp.
        Assume here that the owner of mult.v is "user1" and he is
        a MEMBER of groups 'sos_dev_grp' and 'sos_test_grp'.
        Thus after this any MEMBER or ADMIN of either 'sos_dev_grp'
        or 'sos_test_grp' group will have write access to mult.v

    soscmd create -aReadAccess="owner" -aWriteAccess="owner" add.v
        Add file add.v, only owner has read and write access.

    soscmd create -prjIP -d./mult add.v mult.v
        Add files add.v and mult.v to reference project IP in the
        ./mult directory. "add.v" and "mult.v" get added as a reference
        object in the primary project.

    soscmd create -sr -prjIP -d./mult LIB_1
        Add directory LIB_1 and the sub tree below it to
        reference project "IP" in the "./mult" directory.
        LIB_1 gets added as a reference object in the primary project.
