USAGE
    soscmd modattr [-a<attrname>=<attrvalue>]
              [select options] 
              [pathnames]

DESCRIPTION
    Changes the values of existing attributes or adds new 
    attribute values.

    The attribute must have been defined in the configuration
    file 'setup/sos.cfg' for the project.

ARGUMENTS
    -a<attrname>=<attrvalue>
        This option is used to specify values to attributes
        with this command.
        The attribute name and value are separated by the '='
        character with no spaces in between.
        The attribute name and value must immediately
        follow this option with no spaces.
        If the attribute value has spaces then you must enclose
        the value in double quotes '"'.

        Attribute names may be abbreviated provided there is no
        ambiguity.

    [select options] pathnames
        These are selection options.
        Refer to help for the 'select' command.

        The selections in the SOS window will change to the
        selection specified by these options.

        If no selection option or pathnames are provided then
        the command will be performed on the current selections
        in the SOS window.


    For setting file access control following three attributes
    can be used.
        1) Owner                to define the ownership of the file/dir
        2) ReadAccess           to set read access permissions
        3) WriteAccess          to set write access permissions

NOTES
    The same attribute values will be applied to all selected
    objects.

    The access control attribute names are case sensitive.

    Owner can have any string value.

    ReadAccess and WriteAccess can have only the following
    three values  (all lower case only)
         o owner            Only the owner has access.
         o group            All admins and members of the
                            group or groups the owner belongs
                            to, have access.
                            To define groups please refer to
                            server configuration file "sosd.cfg".
         o world            Any one can have access.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd modattr -awarnings=4 booth.vhd
        Add the attribute 'warnings' and assign it the value '4'
        to the current revision of the file 'booth'vhd'.

    soscmd modattr mult.v add.v -achange_summary="Made synthesizable." \
                                -aregression=passed

        Assign the attribute
           'change_summary' with the value 'Made synthesizable.' 
        and the attribute 
           'regression' with the value 'passed'
        to the current revisions of the files mult.v and add.v.


    soscmd modattr -aOwner="user1" mult.v
        Assign owner to "user1" for file mult.v.
        
    soscmd modattr -aReadAccess="world" mult.v
        Assign read access permissions to any user.
        
    soscmd modattr -aWriteAccess="group" mult.v
        Assign write access permissions to group.
        Assume here that the owner of mult.v is "user1" and he is
        a MEMBER of groups 'sos_dev_grp' and 'sos_test_grp'.
        Thus after this any MEMBER or ADMIN of either 'sos_dev_grp'
        or 'sos_test_grp' group will have write access to mult.v
        If "user1" does not belong to any group, then an error
        message is displayed.

    soscmd modattr -aReadAccess="owner" -aWriteAccess="owner" add.v
        Only owner has read and write access to add.v.
