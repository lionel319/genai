-----------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd showdiffs [-frso<labelnames>] [-ftime<time>] 
                     [-trso<labelname>] [-ttime<time>] 
                     [-out<output file name>]
                     [-op<operations>] [-fmt<format>]
                     [pathname]

DESCRIPTION
    Show differences between 2 RSO's
    in the project if it is under SOS control.
    The command can be run only on a single object or a pathname.
    In case pathname/object is not specified a gui selection must be made.
    

ARGUMENTS
    -frso<rso>
        From rso string. List of comma separated values. 
        If empty then current workarea rso is assumed.

    -trso<rso>
        To rso string. List of comma separated values. 
        If empty then current workarea rso is assumed.

    -out<filename>
        The filename to dump the showdiffs report summary.
        If a relative pathname is provided then it is assumed
        to be relative to the root of the workarea and
        NOT the current working directory.
        If '-outstdout' is specified then the output is redirected
        to stdout.

    -ftime<time>
        Time corresponding to 'from rso'.
        If empty then current time is taken.

    -ttime<time>
        Time corresponding to 'to rso'.
        If empty then current time is taken.

    -op<operations>
        Filter out the operations.
        Valid options are <add,del,upd,nop,all>
        add - Show newly added objects.
        del - Show deleted objects.
        upd - Show updated objects.
        nop - Show objects that haven't changed.
        all - Show all objects.
        By default ONLY the differences are listed in the report. 

    -fmt<format>
        Valid format options are 'txt|csv|htm|csv:noheader"
        Default format is txt.

    pathname
        Only 1 object can be passed as a pathname to this command.

NOTES
    If none of -frso, -trso, -ftime and -ttime are specified then the
    difference between workarea's last updated time and current time 
    is shown for the current workarea rso.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd showdiffs -frsomain -trsoRelease_Complete .
        Show differences between rso's 'main' and 'Release_Complete' for 
        the entire project at current time.

    soscmd showdiffs -frsomain -trsoRelease_Complete ./access
        Show differences between rso's 'main' and 'Release_Complete' at current 
        time for ONLY the './access' object.

    soscmd showdiffs -frsomain -trsoRelease_Complete -fmtcsv:noheader ./access 
        Show differences between rso's 'main' and 'Release_Complete' at current 
        time for ONLY the './access' object in csv format without headers.

    soscmd showdiffs -frsomain -trsoRelease_Complete,Feature_Complete -ftime2016/04/22 -ttime2017/04/22 ./access
        Show differences between rso's 'main' at time '2016/04/22' and 'Release_Complete,Feature_Complete' 
        at time '2017/04/22' for ONLY the './access' object.

    soscmd showdiffs -trsoFeature_Complete .
        Show differences between the current workarea rso and 'Feature_Complete' for 
        the entire project at current time.

    soscmd showdiffs -trsoFeature_Complete -opall .
        Show all objects for the current workarea rso and 'Feature_Complete' for 
        the entire project at current time.

    soscmd showdiffs -frsomain -trsoRelease_Complete -fmtcsv:noheader ./access -outstdout
        Show differences between rso's 'main' and 'Release_Complete' at current
        time for ONLY the './access' object in csv format without headers and 
        redirect the output to stdout.

    soscmd showdiffs -fmthtm -opall .
        Show differences for workarea rso between the last updated time and the 
        current time in html format for the entire project.
