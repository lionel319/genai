soscmd exportrev - bring the selected revision into your 
                   workarea under a different name
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd exportrev [select options] [-out<output file name> | -outdir<out dir name>] [pathnames] [-F]
[pathnames]

DESCRIPTION
    Bring the selected revisions of the selected files into
    your workarea but do not make them the current revision. 

    You need to use this command only if you want to look at a 
    previous version of the file but without making it the
    revision you actually want to use.

    The selected revision of a file is exported under a 
    different name and will NOT overwrite the selected file
    in your work area. The new file name is generated by 
    appending the revision number to the file name separated
    by an '_'.

    For example, if you export '14' of file 'design/core.v' then
    this revision will be exported into the file:
      'design/core_14.v'.

NOTES
    The difference between 'userev' and 'exportrev' is that
    'exportrev' does not replace the selected file with the
    new revision. It places the selected revision under a
    file name created by appending the revision number to the
    actual file name. You would 'export' a revision only if
    you want to look at a previous revision for reference
    but do not really want to use it.

ARGUMENTS
    -out<filename>
        The filename to export the selected revision to.
        This option is valid only for single pathname.
    -outdir<dirname>
        The directory name or path to an existing directory to
        export single or multiple files.
    [select options] pathnames
        These are selection options.
        Refer to help for the 'select' command.

        The selections in the SOS window will change to the
        selection specified by these options.

        If no selection option or pathnames are provided then
        the command will be performed on the current selections
        in the SOS window.
    -F  Overwrite existing file or directory 

EXAMPLES
    soscmd exportrev

        Export the latest revision of '.synopsys' into your 
        workarea.

        Export revisions '7', '2', and '1' of file 'usbcore.v'.
