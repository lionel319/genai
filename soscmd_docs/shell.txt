soscmd shell - execute a shell command
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd shell [command arguments]

DESCRIPTION
    Submits the given command string to SOS to be executed
    as a shell command.

    The shell command string will be executed ONCE in a Bourne
    shell for EACH object selected in the SOS window.

ARGUMENTS
    command
        The shell command to be executed.

    arguments
        The arguments to be passed to the command.

NOTES
    The command is submitted to SOS without any processing.

    It is best to execute shell commands from the 'root' 
    directory of the workarea because SOS is always running
    in that directory. Any pathnames passed as arguments to
    the command must be relative to the 'root' directory
    because this is where the command will actually be invoked.

    Be sure to escape the shell command arguments correctly so 
    that it does NOT get interpreted by the shell from which 
    you are invoking this command.

    When 'soscmd' completes it does NOT mean that the shell
    command has actually completed. The shell command is 
    invoked in the background and may complete much later.

EXAMPLES
    rm -f co.lst
    sos select -sor -sco -slk
    soscmd shell echo '$SOS_CheckedOutBy @ $SOS_CheckOutTime  ::  $SOS_OBJ_PATH' >>co.lst
        This sequence of commands creates a list of all files
        in your work area which are currently locked by you or
        anyone else and also notes who has the file checked out
        and when the file was checked out.
        This list is created in the file 'co.lst' in the root
        directory of the workarea.

        Note how the selections are made first before invoking
        the shell command. Note also that the shell arguments are
        enclosed in single quotes so it does NOT get interpreted 
        by the shell from which you invoke this command.

    echo "Snapshot report created on: `date`" >snapshot.lst
    soscmd select -sr .
    soscmd shell echo '$SOS_OBJ_PATH Rev: $SOS_CURRENT_REV' >>snapshot.lst
        This sequence of commands creates a complete list of
        all the files and directories in the project and
        also prints out the revision, currently in use in the
        workarea, for each one of them. The listing is stored
        in the file 'snapshot.lst'.

    Note: On Windows 'shell' will execute DOS commands.
          
    soscmd shell "echo %SOS_OBJ_PATH%"
        This will print the value of the environment "SOS_OBJ_PATH".
