USAGE
    soscmd rename [oldname] [newname]

DESCRIPTION
    Rename a file or directory in your workarea and
    in the project if it is under SOS control.

    If the renamed object is under SOS control then it is 
    actually NOT renamed in the project repository itself.
    This file will exist with this new name in the new revision 
    of the parent directory.

ARGUMENTS
    oldname
        Name under which the object exists now.

    newname
        The new name to assign to it.

NOTES
    You MUST check out the parent directory before renaming
    objects under it. 
    Remember to check it in after you are done modifying 
    the directory.

    To rename a package, you must check out the package.
    Remember to check it in after the rename is done
    and you are checking in the parent directory.

    You cannot use the rename command to move an object to a
    different directory.
    To move an object use the 'move' command.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd rename add.v adder.v
        Rename the file 'add.v' to 'adder.v'.

    soscmd rename source verilog_src
        Rename the directory 'source' to 'verilog_src'.
