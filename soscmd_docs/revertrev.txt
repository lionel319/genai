soscmd revertrev - revert latest rev back to a previous rev
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd revertrev [-rev<revision>]
                     [-tci<time>]
                     [-b<branchname>]
                     [-a<attrname>=<attrvalue>]
                     [pathname]

DESCRIPTION
    Revert the latest revision of a file back to a previous revision
    without deleting intermediate revs.
    This command basically gets a previous read-only version of
    the file and checks it back in as the latest revision.

    This command should be used sparingly since redundant 
    revisions will get created.

ARGUMENTS
    -a<attrname>=<attrvalue>
        This option is used to specify values to attributes
        with this command.
        The attribute name and value are separated by the '='
        character with no spaces in between.
        The attribute name and value must immediately
        follow this option with no spaces.
        If the attribute value has spaces then you must enclose
        the value in double quotes '"'.

        Attribute names may be abbreviated provided there is no
        ambiguity.

    -rev<revision>
        Specify the revision of the file that you want to revert
        back to.

    -tci<time>
        Revert back to the revision of the file with a
        check in time just before the time specified in
        <YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS> format.

    -b<branchname>
        This option is used along with -tci option to revert
        file back to a revision with specified checkin time 
        on the specified branch.

        This option is used only if -tci option is specified.

NOTES
    -rev and -tci options are mutually exclusive.

    The revertrev operation can be performed on only one file at a
    time.
    A revision cannot be reverted if the file is currently checked
    out by anyone else or you have a previous revision checked out
    in your workarea.

    The revision option or checkin time option must be specified
    along with the pathname.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd revertrev -rev3 usbcore.v
        Bring revision '3' of 'usbcore.scr' as the latest revision
        on the main line.

    soscmd revertrev -revtesting/2 phy.vhd
        Make revision '2' on branch 'testing' the latest revision
        on that branch for file 'phy.vhd'.

    soscmd revertrev -btesting -tci"2012/01/05 08:00:00" netif.vhd
        Make revision checked in before 2012/01/05 08:00:00, 
        on branch 'testing' the latest revision on that branch
        for file 'netif.vhd'.
