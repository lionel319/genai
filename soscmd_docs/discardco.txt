USAGE
    soscmd discardco [-F]
           [-MYD -ED] [-q]
           [select options] 
           [pathnames]

DESCRIPTION
    Cancels the check out of the selected files and directories.
    The check out lock placed on the file or directory is 
    removed allowing others to check it out.
    The permissions of the file in your workarea is changed to 
    read only.

    If a file or directory HAS been modified then it is NOT
    discarded and a warning is issued unless the '-F' option 
    is provided. With the '-F' option the modified file will
    be discarded and all changes will be lost.

ARGUMENTS
    -F
        Discard check out of the file or directory even if
        changes have been made. The changes will be lost.
        Without this option changed files are not discarded.

    -MYD
        Discard check outs by you in any workarea.

    -ED
        Discard check outs by everyone.

    [select options] pathnames
        These are selection options.
        Refer to help for the 'select' command.

        The selections in the SOS window will change to the
        selection specified by these options.

        If no selection option or pathnames are provided then
        the command will be performed on the current selections
        in the SOS window.
    -q
        Quiet or non-verbose  mode. Do not print per object discarded
	checkout  message. Only command summary is printed along with
	the  object count. 

NOTES
    The '-MYD' and '-ED' are mutually exclusive options.

    If neither option is specified, it implies discard check outs
    by you in this workarea only.
