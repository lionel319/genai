soscmd delete - delete files and/or dirs from the project
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd delete [-F] [-U] [-k] [-kco] [pathnames]

DESCRIPTION
    Deletes the specified files and directories from the 
    workarea and from the project if they are under SOS control.

    If a directory is deleted then the files and sub-directories
    below will be recursively deleted. This includes files
    and directories in this workarea sub-tree which are not
    under SOS control.
    
    If the deleted object is under SOS control then it is actually
    NOT deleted from the project repository itself. This file
    will just not exist in the new revision of the parent
    directory.

ARGUMENTS
    -F
        Force deletion of object(s) even if it is checked out by
        someone else.
        NOTE: If the object is checked out by you '-F' will not
              delete it.

    -U
        Delete unmanaged object(s) also from the selected directories
        and below.

    -k  
        Keep managed data in workarea as unmanaged.

    -kco   
        Keep parent directory checked out.

    pathnames
        Names of files and directories in the workarea to be 
        removed.

NOTES
    The object itself must NOT be checked out before delete.

        Delete the directory 'alu' and the files and 
        directories under it. This will not delete any

        NOTE: Directory 'alu' is not deleted if there are
              any objects present under it.

    soscmd delete -U alu
        Delete the directory 'alu' and the files and

    soscmd delete -F alu
        Delete the directory 'alu' and the files and 
        directories under it even if any of the objects are
