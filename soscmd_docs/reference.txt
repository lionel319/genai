soscmd reference - create a reference to an object in an
                   external project
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd reference -prj<project name>
                     -ref<referenced object path>
                     <alias pathname>

DESCRIPTION
    Creates a reference to an object in an external project.
    The name of the external project and the pathname to
    the object in that project defines the target object.
    The object may be referred to with an alias name that is
    different than the name of the target object.

    This is similar in concept to creating a symbolic link
    to an object in a different project. The object remains
    in the external project and is referenced from the current
    project.
    
ARGUMENTS
    -prj<project name>
        This is a required parameter and specifies the name
        of the project where the target object exists.

    -ref<referenced object path>
        Pathname to the referenced (target) object
        in the external project using the current RSO
        for the external project in the current workarea.

        The pathname should be the fully qualified pathname
        starting from the root of the project.

        Note that the referenced object may be a file,
        directory, or package but may NOT be an another
        external reference.

     <alias pathname>
        The pathname as the object should appear in the primary
        project. The pathname should be specified relative to
        the current working directory. The parent directory
        of the pathname should be a managed and populated
        directory. 

        If the parent directory is NOT checked out then SOS
        will automatically checkout the directory to record 
        this external reference and then check it in.

NOTES
    New revisions created for the target object are available
     to be shared by all projects referencing this object.

    Even if the target object is deleted, renamed or moved in
    the target project the projects referencing this object
    will still have access to this object.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd reference -prjIPLIB -ref./lowpower/dff8 ./rtl/counter/reg8
        Create a reference to the object './lowpower/dff8' in the
        project 'IPLIB' in the managed directory './rtl/counter'
        with the name 'reg8'. 

    soscmd reference -prjIPLIB -ref./lowpower/dff8 reg8
        Create a reference to the object './lowpower/dff8' in the
        project 'IPLIB' in the current directory with the 
        name 'reg8'. The current working directory must be a
        managed and populated directory.
