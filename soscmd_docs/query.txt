DESCRIPTION
    This command queries workarea and project-specific
    information from sos.

ARGUMENTS
    -r
        List only the retired labels.
        Applicable to tags, branches, snapshots and labels only.

    -A
        List all (active and retired) labels.
        List all (primary and reference) projects.
        Applicable to tags, branches, snapshots, labels and project only.

    -q
        List labels with qualifiers.
        Applicable to tags, branches, snapshots and labels only.
        Currently only the following 4 qualifiers are supported for
        branch 'main' : file, dir, owner, group.
        This option is used to get the labels to apply to the
        Revision Search Order during workarea update.

    -P<project name>
        Query the specified project. This can be
        the primary project or a reference project. If this
        option is not specified, the query will be run
        for the primary project.
        Multiple '-P' options may NOT be specified.
        Not applicable to 'project' option.

    -export
        Get only the list of exported attributes. Supported only with
        'soscmd query attributes'. 
  
    -ucl
        List all the projects available in the client without 
        querying corresponding servers' online status.
        Applicable only with 'soscmd query project -A'.

    tags
        Get the list of tags in the current or specified project.

    branches
        Get the list of branches in the current or specified project.

    snapshots
        Get the list of snapshots in the current or specified project.

    labels
        Get the list of tags, branches and snapshots in the
        current or specified project.

    rso
        Get the Revision Search Order of the workarea for
        current or specified project.

    server
        Get the name of the server used for the current or specified project.

    project
        Get the symbolic name of the project you are working on.

    project_path
        Get the absolute path to the project repository as seen
        from the server for current or specified project.

    wa_root
        Get the absolute path of the root directory of the
        current workarea.

    last_update_time
        Get the time of the last update in the workarea
        for current or specified project.

    rollback_time
        Get the time to which the workarea was rolled back
        for current or specified project.

    is_offline
        Get status whether the workarea can connect to the
        SOS server for current or specified project.
        Returns '0' if the server is up and sos can
        connect to it;
        '1' if the server is up but sos was started in offline
         mode so cannot connect to it until restarted;
        '2' if server is not up;
        '3' if the server is up but sos cannot connect to
        it due to protocol mismatch or clock skew.

    is_running
        Get status whether sos process is running in the
        workarea.
        Does not start sos if it is not running.
        Returns '0' if the sos process is not running in
        the workarea;
        '1' if it is running.

    is_nowin
        Get mode of sos.
        Returns '0' if sos is running in windows mode.
        '1' if sos is running in non-windows mode but can
         switch to windows mode.
        '2' if sos is running in non-windows mode and cannot
         switch to windows mode.
