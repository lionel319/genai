USAGE
    soscmd undelete [-d<rev_depth>] <directory pathname> 
           <list of object names to be undeleted>

DESCRIPTION
    undeletes the specified objects from the directory.

    The directory from which objects are to be undeleted must
    be a populated directory. There should be a current version
    in the workarea and it should be the latest revision on that
    branch.

ARGUMENTS
    -d<rev_depth>
        The number of revisions to search for the deleted objects.
        This is an optional argument.

        NOTE:
        The default rev_depth is five. That is it will search 
        the last 5 revisions to locate objects to be undeleted.

    directory pathname
        The pathname of the directory in which the given objects
        are to be undeleted.

    list of object names to be undeleted
        Space separated list of object names to be undeleted.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd undelete alu  mult
        undelete the 'mult' object from the 'alu' directory.
        This will search in the last 5 revision of 'alu' from the 
        current revision in the workarea. If 'mult' obj was deleted
        in the last 5 revisions then it is undeleted.

    soscmd undelete -d13 ./PC/dvd blueRay sdFlash
        undelete 'blueRay' and 'sdFlash' objects from the
        './PC/dvd' directory. This will search in the last 13
        revision of './PC/dvd' directory from the current revision
        in the workarea. If 'blueRay' and/or 'sdFlash' are found
        to be deleted in the last 13 revisions then all the found
        objects are undeleted.
