soscmd usebranch - Set a branch as project RSO
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd usebranch [-P<project name>] <branchName>

DESCRIPTION
    Set the project RSO with the specified branch.
    If the branch is a "file branch" then the branch is prepended
    to the current RSO. If the branch is a "project branch" then
    the RSO will be branch_name, branchName_BRANCH_baseline
    where branchName_BRANCH_baseline is  snapshot taken when that
    branch was defined.

    
ARGUMENTS
    -P<project name>
        Use branch for the specified project(s).
        If project name is the special keyword 'All', then
        branch is used for all projects (primary and reference).
        Multiple '-P' options are allowed.
        If this option is not specified, the branch will be used
        in the primary project.

    <branchName>
        Branch name to be used for the given project.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd usebranch -PUSB3 main
        Set RSO for project "USB3" to "main"

    soscmd usebranch -PAll speedopt
        Set RSO for all projects to "speedopt,speedopt_BRANCH_baseline"
        assuming speedopt is a "project branch".
