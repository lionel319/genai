soscmd snapshot - take a snapshot of the workarea
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd snapshot [-F -Nr -Na -n<snapshotname> -i]
                    [-d<description>]
                    [-aExport="yes|no"]
                    [select options] 
                    [pathnames]


DESCRIPTION
    Takes a snapshot of the selected directories.
    The current revisions of all the files and directories 
    including and below the selected directories will be tagged
    with the given snapshot name.

    The snapshot can be used to recreate your workarea, exactly 
    as it is now, at any later time.

    To take a snapshot of a directory you must NOT have the
    directory itself or any object under it checked out.

    If the given snapshot name already exists then the snapshot
    command will fail. If you want to overwrite the existing
    snapshot then you must use the '-F' option.

ARGUMENTS
    -n<snapshotname>
        Specify the name of the snapshot to take.

        At least one snapshot name must be provided with the
        snapshot command. You may use multiple '-n' options.

    -d<description>
        A single line description of the snapshot. If the
        description has spaces then enclose it in 
        double-quotes '"'.

    -F
        Overwrite the snapshot even if it exists.
        Without this option the snapshot command will fail if
        a snapshot with the same name already exists.

    -Nr
        Do NOT recursively include objects below selected dirs
        in the snapshot. Only apply the snapshot to the selected
        objects.

    -Na 
        Do NOT include ancestor objects i.e. directories above the
        selected objects. Only apply the snapshot to the selected 
        objects. 

    -i
        Include writeable reference projects in the snapshot. Without
        this option the snapshot will only be applied to objects in
        the primary project.
        
    -aExport="yes|no"
        Optional attribute to indicate whether a true or false 
        attribute is exported for this snapshot on each object. If set
        to yes, then an attribute called Snapshot_<snapshotname> is set to 
        "T" or "F" for true and false respectively.  
        Default value if this option is not specified is "no".

    [select options] pathnames
        These are selection options.
        Refer to help for the 'select' command.

        The selections in the SOS window will change to the
        selection specified by these options.

        If no selection option or pathnames are provided then
        the command will be performed on the current selections
        in the SOS window.

NOTES
    Tags, branches, and snapshots are in the same name space
    and are referred to as 'labels'. So names of tags, 
    branches, and snapshots have to be unique.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd snapshot -nsim_passed
        Take a snapshot called 'sim_passed' for the currently
        selected directories in the SOS window.

    soscmd snapshot -ntapeout_1 -d"First tapeout on schedule!" /
        Take a snapshot called 'tapeout_1' of the entire 
        project tree. Associate the description:
            First tapeout on schedule!
        with the snapshot.

    soscmd snap -nsim_passed -F .
        Take a snapshot called 'sim_passed' of the current
        working directory and overwrite it even if a snapshot
        with the same name already exists.

    soscmd snap -n97_Nov -d"Monthly snapshot." sim syn
        Take a snapshot called '97_Nov' of the directories
        'sim' and 'syn' and associate the description:
            Monthly snapshot.

    soscmd snap -nsim_passed -Nr hdl decoder.v encoder.v
        Take a snapshot called 'sim_passed' of the directory
        'hdl' and the files 'decoder.v' and 'encoder.v' but
        do not include other files and directories in the 
        'hdl' dir.
