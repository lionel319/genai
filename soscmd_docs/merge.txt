soscmd merge - Merge a revision of a file into the checked out revision.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd merge [-ma -mm -mo]
                 [-rev<revision>] 
                 [-rbase<base revision>] 
                 [pathname]

DESCRIPTION
    Merge the specified revision into the checked out revision 
    of the file.

ARGUMENTS
    -ma  -mm  -mo
        These are mutually exclusive options. They specify what
        sort of merge to do.
          -ma --> Do an automatic merge with the checked out revision
                  If conflicting changes are detected a message will
                  be displayed. This is not allowed for symbolic links.
          -mm --> You have already done a manual merge with the
                  checked out revision and would just like to record
                  that a merge was done. No modifications are
                  made to the checked out file.
                  For symbolic links this means to do a record merge
                  and keep the target as it is.
          -mo --> You would like to over write the checked out file
                  with the contents of the specified revision and
                  record that a merge was done.
                  For symbolic links this means to use the target of
                  -rev<revision> and record a merge,
        
    -rev<revision>
        Specify the revision of the file that you want to merge
        into the checked out file.

    -rbase<base revision>
        Specify the revision of the file to use as the base version
        for the automatic merge of the two revisions. This is the
        common ancestor revision from where the two revisions deviated.
        This option is ignored in case of symbolic links.

        The base revision is automatically determined by SOS during
        an automatic merge. This is an optional argument and is 
        required only if you want to override the default. 

NOTES
    The merge operation can be performed on only one file at a
    time.

    One of the mutually exclusive merge options and the
    revision option must be specified along with the pathname.

    The file must be checked out before a merge is done.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd merge -ma -rev4 -rbase4 alu/mult/booth.vhd
        Merge revision 4 of the file 'booth.vhd' in the directory
        'mult' contained in the directory 'alu' into the checked out
        revision using revision 4 as the base revision.

    soscmd merge -mm -revbugfix/2 top.v
        Record merge of revision 2 on branch 'bugfix' of the
        file 'top.v' into the checked out revision. No changes
        are made to the file.

    soscmd merge -mo -rev2 adder.vhd
        Overwrite the checked out file 'adder.vhd' with the
        contents of revision 2 of the file. Record that a
        merge was done.
