soscmd deleterev - delete the selected revision from the database
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd deleterev [pathnames]

DESCRIPTION
    Delete the selected revisions of the file or directory.
    Note that the revisions will be expunged from the SOS
    database and you cannot get that revision back.

    All tags associated with this revision will be deleted.
    If this revision is part of a snapshot then the revision
    cannot be deleted.

    This command should be used sparingly and only to delete
    revisions that you really do not want.

    If all the revisions on a branch are deleted then the branch
    itself will be deleted.

ARGUMENTS
    pathnames
        Pathnames to the object revisions to be deleted.
        Revision number is appended to the end of the
        object name separated by a slash.

        The selections in the SOS window will change to the
        selection specified.

        If no pathnames are provided then the command will 
        be performed on the current selections
        in the SOS window.

NOTES
    A revision cannot be deleted if it is currently checked out 
    by anyone.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd deleterev usbcore.v/7  usbcore.scr/3
        Get rid of revision '7' of file 'usbcore.v' and revision
        '3' of 'usbcore.scr'.

    soscmd deleterev phy.vhd/testing/1
        Delete revision '1' of file 'phy.vhd' on branch 
        'testing'. If this is the only revision on the branch
        then delete the branch itself.
