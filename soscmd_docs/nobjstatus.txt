USAGE
    soscmd nobjstatus [-rev<version>] [-ga<attrName>]
                     [-ucl] [-out<filename>] [pathnames]

DESCRIPTION
    This command displays the status and attributes of the files
    and directories specified by pathname(s).

    If rev option is not specified, the command returns the status
    of the current revision in the workarea.

    The status is returned in the form of 2 numbers where the first
    indicates the state of the object and second value indicates
    the object type.

    The values for status are :
    0 - Path does not belong in the specified workarea
    1 - Object does not exist in the workarea
    2 - Object exists in the workarea, but is not managed by sos
    3 - Object is currently checked out in the workarea
    4 - Object is currently checked out in a different workarea
    5 - Object is currently checked in at the server
    6 - Object is currently checked out in the workarea but not
        locked in the server

    The values for object type are :
    0 - Object type not known
    1 - Object is a file
    2 - Object is a directory
    3 - Object is a package

ARGUMENTS
    -rev
        Specify the version of object to get information about.

    -ga<attrname>
        This option is used to specify which attributes of the
        object should be returned by the command.
        If this option is not specified only the object state
        and type are returned; no attributes will be returned.

        If attrname is the special keyword 'All', then all
        available attributes are returned.

        Multiple '-ga' options are allowed.

    -ucl
        This option is used for optimization. It indicates that
        the object status should be returned from the information
        available in the client without querying with the server.
        This is typically used for large selections where the client
        already has the latest information after an update of
        flags & attributes.

    -out<filename>
         Write the status output to the file specified by filename.
         If this option is not specified, the output is written to
         the standard out.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd nobjstatus ./alu.txt
        Print the status of the current version in the workarea
        of the file 'alu.txt' to the standard output.

    soscmd nobjstatus -rev2 -gaAll -outreport.out ./myObject.txt
        Print the status and version details of revision 2 of the
        'myObject.txt' file in the current directory to the file
        'report.out'.

    soscmd nobjstatus -rev2 -gachange_summary -gaLog ./alu.txt
        Print the status and 'change_summary' and 'Log'
        attributes of revision 2 of the 'alu.txt' file in the
        current directory to stdout.

    soscmd nobjstatus -ucl -gaAll -outreport.out ./docs/*
        Print the status and version details of the current
        versions of all objects in the 'docs' directory
        to the file 'report.out' without querying the server
        for details.
