----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd ci [-D]
              [-F]
              [-a<attrname>=<attrvalue>]
              [-ma mm -mo]
              [-Nco -kco]
              [-T<tagName> [-ft] [-Na]]
              [-rev<rev num>]
              [select options]
	      [-q] 
              [pathnames]

DESCRIPTION
    Checks in previously checked out files and directories.
    When an object is checked in a new revision of the object
    is created. The check out lock placed on the file or 
    directory is removed allowing others to check it out.
    The permissions of the file in your workarea is changed to 
    read only.

    If a file or directory has NOT been modified then it is
    not checked in and a warning is issued unless the '-F' 
    or '-D' options are provided.

    If no value is provided for the 'Log' attribute then you
    WILL be prompted to enter a log of your changes.

ARGUMENTS
    -D
        Discard the check out of any file or directory to which
        NO changes have been made. Without this option unchanged 
        files will not be discarded.

    -F
        Check in the file or directory even if NO changes have 
        been made. Without this option unchanged files will not
        be checked in.

    -a<attrname>=<attrvalue>
        This option is used to specify values to attributes
        with this command.
        The attribute name and value are separated by the '='
        character with no spaces in between.
        The attribute name and value must immediately
        follow this option with no spaces.
        If the attribute value has spaces then you must enclose
        the value in double quotes '"'.

        Attribute names may be abbreviated provided there is no
        ambiguity.

    -ma  -mm  -mo
        These are mutually exclusive options. They specify what
        sort of merge to do when you are trying to checkin a
        file and new revisions of this file have been introduced
        since you checked it out. This situation can only arise
        if the concurrent checkout capability is being used.
          -ma --> Do an automatic merge with the latest revision
                  Checkin will be aborted if conflicting changes
                  are detected.
          -mm --> You have already done a manual merge with the
                  latest revision and would just like to record
                  that a merge was done.
          -mo --> You are not interested in merging and would
                  like to check in your file as is. If you use
                  this option you are probably over riding 
                  changes made by someone else.
        
    -Nco
        This will allow a file or directory to be checked in
        even if it is not checked out.

    -kco
        This will leave the file or directory checked out after the
        check in.

    -T<tagNames>
        Attach the tags to the new revision created on checkin.

    -ft
        This option is only used if -T<tagName> is specified.
        Force tag even if the tag moves from newer to older version
        on the same branch for implicitly tagged ancestor directories.

    -Na
        This option is only used if -T<tagName> is specified.
        Do not tag ancestor directories. If this option is not specified
        then ancestor directories are tagged.

    -rev<rev num>
        Specify an integer revision number to be assigned to the
        checked in revision. Note that the revision number must
        be an integer greater than the latest revision on the
        branch the file is checked out on.
    -q
        Quiet or non-verbose  mode. Do not print per object checkin   status message. Only
        command summary is printed along with the checked in  object count. 

    [select options] pathnames
        These are selection options.
        Refer to help for the 'select' command.

        The selections in the SOS window will change to the
        selection specified by these options.

        If no selection option or pathnames are provided then
        the command will be performed on the current selections
        in the SOS window.

NOTES
    If multiple files are to be checked in by the same command
    then you will NOT be prompted to enter a separate log message
    for each file. The same log message and other attribute values
    will be used for all the files checked in.

    The '-D' and '-F' options are mutually exclusive. You may use
    one or the other but not both.

    If the 'change_summary' attribute in not specified but the 
    'Log' attribute is provided then the FIRST LINE of the 'Log'
    will be used as the 'change_summary'.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd ci
        Check in all files and directories which are currently
        selected in the SOS window.

    soscmd ci .synopsys
        Check in the file '.synopsys'.

    soscmd ci alu/mult/booth.vhd
        Check in the file 'booth.vhd' in the directory 'mult'
        contained in the directory 'alu'.

    soscmd ci *.vhd
        Check in all the files with the '.vhd' extension in the
        current working directory.

    soscmd ci -F *.vhd
        Check in all the files with the '.vhd' extension in the
        current working directory even if no changes have been
        made.

    soscmd ci -D -sco
        Check in all the files checked out in this workarea.
        If a file has not been changed then do not check it
        in but instead cancel the check out.

    soscmd ci .
        Check in the current directory.

    soscmd ci -achange_summary="Instantiated adder." top.vhd
        Check in 'top.vhd' and assign the 'change_summary'
        attribute the value:
            Instantiated adder.

    soscmd ci -sco -aLog="Got rid of synthesis warnings."
        Check in all files which are currently checked out in
        this work area and assign the 'Log' attribute the value:
            Got rid of synthesis warnings.

    soscmd ci -achange_summary="Instantiated adder." -rev101 top.vhd
        Check in 'top.vhd' and assign the 'change_summary'
        attribute the value:
            Instantiated adder.
        Make the number of the new revision to be 101 without
        regard to what the current revision is.

    soscmd ci -sco -achange_summary="No warnings!" \
              -aLog="Got rid of synthesis warnings."
        Check in all files which are currently checked out in
        this work area and assign the 'Log' attribute the value:
            Got rid of synthesis warnings.
        and the 'change_summary' attribute the value:
            No warnings!

    soscmd ci -Nco -sw -F -T"gold silver" -achange_summary="Test" -aLog="Test"
        Check in all files that are writable even if they are not
        checked out (-sw will only select writable files).
        Force if there is no change.
        Attach the tags 'gold' and 'silver' to the new revision
        after checkin.
        Do not print any information messages.
