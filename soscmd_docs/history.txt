DESCRIPTION
    This command displays the history of changes made to the
    selected files. All previous check in and tag operations
    and any current check outs will be listed.

    The history of changes is listed in reverse chronological 
    order.

ARGUMENTS
    -from<date+time>
        The local date and time from which the history should be
        displayed. The date and time is specified in local time
        and converted appropriately on the server.
        The format for specifying date+time is:
            "YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS"
        You must start with the year but you can choose to
        specify as little as you want. The parts not specified
        will be assumed to be 0.

        You can also specify the number of days before the 
        current date by indicating a negative integer: "-N".

        If this option is not specified then it will default
        to start of the project.        

    -to<date+time>
        The local date and time up to which the history should be
        displayed. The date and time is specified in local time
        and converted appropriately on the server.
        The format for specifying date+time is:
            "YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS"
        You must start with the year but you can choose to
        specify as little as you want. The parts not specified
        will be assumed to be 0.

        If this option is not specified then it will default
        to the current time.

    -cmd<command name>
        This option is a filter to specify which command will 
        be listed in the history output. The option can be used
        multiple times to specify multiple commands. The following 
	are valid command names for history command option:
          create, co, ci, tag, termbranch

        If this option is not specified then all commands are
        listed.

    -user<user name>
        This option will show history records for a user.
	The option can be used multiple times to specify multiple users.

        If this option is not specified then all user records are
        listed.

        NOTE: if -user and -cmd is specified then the filter will 
	      AND both the results.

    -out<filename>
        The filename to dump the history to instead of stdout.
        If a relative pathname is provided then it is assumed
        to be relative to the root of the workarea and
        NOT the current working directory.

    -fs
       Format each command in a single line instead of the 
       default multi-line format. This is useful if the file is
       to be parsed in scripts.

    [select options] pathnames
        These are selection options.
        Refer to help for the 'select' command.

        The selections in the SOS window will change to the
        selection specified by these options.

        If no pathnames are provided then the command will be 
        performed on the current selections in the SOS window.

        Print the history of the files and directories selected
        in the SOS window.
