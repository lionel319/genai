soscmd pack - manage sos composite object 'package' 
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd pack [-C | -A | -U | -show ] [pkg path] [[component names] | [-sfile<file name containing component names>]]

DESCRIPTION
    Create new package, Append files to an existing package,
    Remove files from an existing package or List contents
    of a package.

    The package object is provided to support the requirement
    of several EDA tools to treat multiple files as part of a
    single design object.


ARGUMENTS
    -C
        This option is used to create a new package or re-pack
        an existing package.

    -A
        This option is used to append new file(s) to an existing
        package.

    -U
        This option is used to unpack an unmanaged package.
        A package added to sos revision control cannot be
        unpacked.

    -show
        This option is used to display the contents of a package.

    pkg path
        Create the composite object with this name. The object is
        created in sos and does not exist on disk. The name of the
        object can be the name of an existing directory or file.
        This directory or file will no longer be accessible from
        sos for data management operations once the package is 
        created.

    -sfile<file>
          
         Package object component files  whose paths are specified in the file
         <file>. <file> should contain one path per line.
         Paths in the file can be absolute or relative to the
         workarea root. All paths should be from the same workarea. 

    component names
        Names of 'temporary' files in the workarea that should be
        part of the composite object.
        All component pathnames should be specified relative
        to the parent directory of the package file.

NOTES
    The '-C', '-A', '-U' and '-show' options are mutually exclusive.
    One of the above options must be specified.

    A package can only consist of files at the same level or below
    the package path itself.
    The component files must be unmanaged. They cannot be separately
    managed under sos.


EXAMPLES
    soscmd pack -C libn/celln celln/file1 celln/file2
        Create package celln whose components are file1 and file2
        files under celln directory.

    soscmd pack -A libn/celln celln/file3 celln/file4
        Append files file3 and file4 to the existing package
        'libn/celln' that was created in the previous example.

    soscmd pack -show mypack
        List the components of the mypack package.

    soscmd pack -U mypack.v
        Unpack the mypack.v package.

    soscmd pack -C big_pdk -sfile./packcomps
        Create a package big_pdk whose components are specified in the file
	packcomps.
