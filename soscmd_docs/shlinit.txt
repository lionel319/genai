shlinit - Initialize the shared library.
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd shlinit [-vk<vendor key>]
              [-prefix<errMsgPrefix>]
              [-t<timeout>]

DESCRIPTION
    Establish communication with the sos shared library used by a
    vendor tool.

    This function records the connection with a sos shared
    library for a vendor tool. It checks out the sos license for
    the interface to that tool and returns the version number to
    ensure the shared library and sos are compatible.

ARGUMENTS

    -vk<vendor key>
        This is a unique integer identifying the vendor tool
        using the sos shared library.

    -prefix<errMsgPrefix>
        errMsgPrefix can have values 1 or 0. If 1 is specified,
        every sos message will be prefixed with the severity of
        that message and returned to the tool as a formatted
        string. Values 0 indicates the messages will be returned
        without severity information in the message string.

    -t<timeout>
        Specify time of inactivity, in minutes, after which sos
        should exit automatically. This should typically be set
        to zero here, to disable the timeout, as long as the sos
        shared library is connected to the sos session. The value
        can be set back in shlCleanup.

NOTES
    This command returns the version number of the sos process
    to ensure that sos and the shared library are compatible.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd shlinit -vk1 -prefix0 -t0
