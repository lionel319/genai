soscmd addreference - add a reference object to the project
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd addreference -prj<project name> -ref<referenced object path> 
                        -Np <alias pathname> -p [-l<label names>]

DESCRIPTION
    Adds the specified file, package or directory from the given project
    to the current project with the name as "alias pathname".

ARGUMENTS
    -prj<project name>
        This specifies the project name from which the reference is to
        be added.

    -ref<referenced object path>
        This specifies the reference object name to be added.
        The path has to be specified as relative path from the project
        root directory.
        If this is a directory the entire directory hierarchy will be
        added as a reference.

    -Np
        Do not populate the added reference object.
        
    -p  Add a reference revision search order to the project repository.
        This will affect all user workareas.
    
    -l<labelname>
        Specify the name of the tag, snapshot, or branch name to
        be used in the revision search order.

        Multiple '-l' options may be specified to create a 
        revision search order consisting of multiple labels.
        The order in which the labels appear on the command 
        line will be the order in which they will be placed
        in the revision search order.

    <alias pathname>
        The reference object name as it should appear in the current project.
        A relative path can be specified from the current directory to
        place the reference in the directory hierarchy.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd addreference -p -prjTrinityCPU -ref./PWM_LIB/Comparator ./utility/AnalogCompare  
        Add the directory "./PWM_LIB/Comparator" from the "TrinityCPU"
        project to the current project under the "./utility" directory
        with an alias name of "AnalogCompare"
    
    soscmd addreference -p -prjTrinityCPU -ref./PWM_LIB/Comparator -lRelease_A1 ./utility/Comparator 
        Add the directory "./PWM_LIB/Comparator" from the "TrinityCPU"
        project to the current project under the "./utility" directory. 
        This object and all its children 
        below will use "Release_A1" as their RSO.
