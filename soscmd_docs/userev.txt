soscmd userev - bring the selected revision into your workarea
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd userev [-rso] [-t<time>] [select options] [pathnames]

DESCRIPTION
    Bring the selected revisions of the selected files into
    your workarea. 

    You need to use this command only if you want to pick a 
    revision of a file which does not match your revision 
    search order or if you want to get new revisions of only
    some select files without updating your entire workarea.

ARGUMENTS
    -rso
        This will apply the current revision search order
        used by update cmd to the selected file(s) and bring
        that revision into your workarea. This option is 
        similar to the update cmd except that it only updates
        the selected files and not the entire workarea.
        If this option is used any specific revision number
        specified after the pathnames is ignored.
    
     -t<time>
        Bring the selected object's  revision into the
        workarea based on the current RSO AND  with a check
        in time just before the time specified in 
        <YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS> format.
       
    [select options] pathnames
        These are selection options.
        Refer to help for the 'select' command.

        The selections in the SOS window will change to the
        selection specified by these options.

        If no selection option or pathnames are provided then
        the command will be performed on the current selections
        in the SOS window.
   
EXAMPLES
    soscmd userev
        Bring the revisions of files selected in the SOS window
        into your workarea.

    soscmd userev .synopsys/main
        Get the latest revision of '.synopsys' into your 
        workarea.

    soscmd use usbcore.v/7  usbcore.scr/3
        Get revision '7' of file 'usbcore.v' and revision '3'
        of 'usbcore.scr' into your workarea.

    soscmd userev -rso README/2
        Apply the current Revision Search Order and get the
        updated revision of 'README' into your workarea. This
        is like updating only the file 'README'. The specific
        revision (specified as /2) is ignored when -rso is
        present.
        
    soscmd userev -rso -sr DOCS_DIR
        This is like updating the entire dir 'DOCS_DIR'.
