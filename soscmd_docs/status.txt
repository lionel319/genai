DESCRIPTION
    This command displays the status of the objects specified by pathname(s),selected 
    in current workarea. The output of the command is a table listing the 
    status information of the objects requested. The column headers are.

	  T   S  D   C   L   N   R   V   P  A  I  O
	  --  -- --  --  --	 --  --	 -- -- 	-- -- --

    T => Type of object in workarea. Possible values :

      p -> Package.
      d -> Directory.
      s -> Symbolic Link.
      F -> Reference File.
      P -> Reference Package.
      D -> Reference Dir.
      S -> Reference Symbolic Link.
          
    S => State of the object selected in the workarea. Possible values:
      O -> Checked out.                    
      - -> Checked In.

      N -> Unpopulated
      - -> Populated for dirs and not applicable for objects other than dir. 

      For dir the value is used in conjunction with column S value.
                 column S  | column D |     state
                    -           -         dir and all underneath objects are populated.
                    -           P         dir is populated and atleast one
                                              underneath object is unpopulated.

    C => Change status of the selected object in workarea. Possible values:
      M -> Modified in this workarea. This could mean any of the following:-
			    a) If the object is a file, dir or package, it was
			       checked out in workarea and modified. 
			    b) If the object is a file or package, it was NOT
			       checked out, but made writable in workarea and modified.

    L => Lock status of the object. 
      L -> Locked. This means the object is Checked Out in some other workarea.
      - -> Not locked.	
      ? -> Not applicable.

    N => Prints whether a  revision exists in the repository which is newer than the 
         rev present in the workarea.
      Possible values:
        - -> No i.e. workarea has  the latest revision. 
      N -> Not using latest revision i.e. a newer revision exists in the repository. 
      ? -> Not applicable.

    R  => Current revision of object DOES NOT match the RSO. Possible values:
      - -> Workarea revision matches RSO.
      R -> Does not match RSO.	
      ? -> Not applicable.

    V  => Revision number of object selected . Possible values:
		  Revision number OR "?" if object is unmanaged or no revision matches RSO.

    P  => Path of object in workarea relative to workarea root.
    A  => Author name. Name of the user who checked in or checked out the object.
    I  => Check in or Check out time.
    O  => Check in or check out log.
 
NOTES
    An update of flags and attributes is done from the server before displaying 
    status if any of  the following columns are requested :
    Lock status (L), New revision (N), Match RSO (M). 
    For the remaining columns the status is obtained  from the workearea.

    The status command returns the current status and version of object in workarea so
    it will Not support a version/tag/branch selection.

ARGUMENTS

  -f<Format string> 
      Specify a format string for column display. The name of each column is the 
      column header i.e. any of the chars->  T,S,D,N,R,L,V,P,A,I,O  preceded by a percentage 
      symbol.  eg. -f"%T  %P" would display only the two columns-type and Path delimited 
      by 2 spaces. If this option is not specified then the default format string is 
      "%T%S%D%C%L%N%R\t%V\t%A\t%I\t%O\t%P".

  -v
      Verbose. Prints a brief explanation of the status output columns and the 
      codes at the end of the output. 

	
  -P<project name>
      If an update of flags and attributes is to be done then update the
      specified project. Multiple -P options can be used. If -P contains the 
      keyword 'All' , then all primary and reference projects are updated
      for flags and attributes. If no -P option is specified then the default
      is to update ALL the primary and reference projects ( same as -pAll
      option).

  -Nhdr 
      Display status output without column header names. This is the default
      option.

  -hdr
      Display status output with column headers.

   
  The select option flags are the same as those for the select command 
  without the -A and -V options. Refer to the help on select command for an  
  explanation on the flags/filters. If multiple filters are specified then the result 
  is an OR of each  filter as opposed to an AND in select command.  If no filters
  are specified, the status command applies to ALL objects in the workarea and
  returns ALL columns.


pathname
   The path to a file/directory/package in the workarea. Refer to pathname 
   section in help of select command. You can specify multiple pathnames.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd status -sr  -snt -snl .
        Print the status information of all objects under the current
        directory recursively that do not match the rso or have an older
        revision in the workarea.  This command is useful when executed from
        workarea root because  users can know the extent to which their
        workarea is in sync with the repository before  doing an actual update 
        of objects. 

    soscmd status -v -f"%T\t%S\t%L\t%P" -sfo  .
	Prints status information  containing the 1 tab space 
        delimited columns - type, workarea status, lock status and path of 
        object for ALL files under current directory recursively. Prints 
        the description of output ( columns and status codes) at the end.
	
    soscmd status -sm -hdr  -f"%T\t%V\t%S\t%C\t%P"
        Prints the workarea-only status information of managed objects. No
        update of flags and attributes from server is done since none of the 
        L,N,R columns were requested. This command can be used if you have large 
        number of objects in your workarea and just want to check the integrity 
        of the workarea objects without requiring to compare against the repository.

    soscmd status -sm  -f"%T\t%A\t%I\t%P\t\t\t%O" foo
        Prints the type ,author, check in time , path and check in log summary
        of all managed objects under foo. 
           
    soscmd status -sr  .
        Prints the entire non verbose status information of all objects 
     	in the current directory recursively.

    soscmd status 
        Prints the status information  showing  all columns for the objects
        already selected. The attribute columns i.e. the A (Author) , I(Time)
        and O (Log) are not displayed by default.
