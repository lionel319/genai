soscmd - provides a command line interface to sos
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd <command name> [command arguments]

DESCRIPTION
    'soscmd' takes command line arguments and submits them to
    SOS for execution.  

    'soscmd' itself does very little command processing besides
    some simple error checking. It merely submits all the 
    command line arguments to SOS for execution.

    'soscmd' and SOS need NOT have to run on the same machine.
    'soscmd' will communicate with an existing SOS session for
    the current workarea no matter which machine it is 
    running on.

    If SOS is not running then 'soscmd' will attempt to invoke
    it.

    'soscmd' may be invoked ONLY from the workarea directory
    or any of its sub-directories.

        For more information on any command type:
            help <command name>

        To determine the version of SOS type:
            version 

    command arguments
        Most of the commands are of the form:
           command [options] [pathnames]
        The 'options' and 'pathnames' may appear in any order.

NOTES
    You may use shell wildcards like '*' to specify pathnames
    but you should remember that the shell and not 'soscmd'
    does the wildcard substitution.

    It would be convenient to setup aliases for some of the
    common commands in your '.cshrc' file. For example:
      alias sosco 'soscmd co'
      alias sosci 'soscmd ci'

EXAMPLES
    soscmd update
        Update the workarea using the current revision search
        order.

    soscmd co *.v ../top.v
        This command checks out all the files with the extension
        '.v' in the current directory and also the file 'top.v'
        in the parent dir.

    soscmd co alu.v/main
        Check out the latest revision of 'alu.v' on the 'main'
        line of development.

    soscmd diff alu.v/12 alu.v/gold
        Show the difference between revision '12' of alu.v and
        the revision tagged 'gold'.

    soscmd discardco -F /stim.dat
        Discard the check out of file 'stim.dat' in the root
        directory of the workarea even if it has been modified.

    soscmd ci -sco -achange_su="Fixed race condition."
        Check in ALL the checked out files with a 
        'change_summary' of:
            Fixed race condition.
