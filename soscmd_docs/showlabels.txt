DESCRIPTION
    Show all the revisions in the repository that match 
    the specified labels or show all the labels applied on an object.

ARGUMENTS
    -l<labelName>
        Specify the name of the tag, snapshot, or branch name to
        be used for displaying the revisions.
        Multiple '-l' options may be specified to show revisions 
        corresponding to each label.
        
        Other accepted values are 'tags' 'snapshots' 'branches' 'all'.
        Only one of these special values can be specified at a time
        and cannot be combined with actual label names through multiple
        '-l' options.

        If this argument is not provided then revisions for all tags and 
        snapshots are displayed.
    
    -show
        list of labels applied to any version of the selected object.

        do not show labels applied to child objects of the selected object.

        Default format is txt.

    -out<filename>

        If a relative pathname is provided then it is assumed
        to be relative to the root of the workarea and
        NOT the current working directory.
        If '-outstdout' is specified then the output is redirected
        to stdout.
