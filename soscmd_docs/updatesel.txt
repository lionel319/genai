soscmd updatesel - update the selected objects in your workarea
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd updatesel [-t<time>] [-ccw] [-Nr] [select options] [pathnames]

DESCRIPTION
    Bring the revisions that match your current Revision Search Order
    of the selected files into your workarea. 
    Repopulate selected directories so new files are brought into
    the workarea.

    You need to use this command only if you want to get new
    revisions of only some select files without updating your
    entire workarea.

    NOTE : All selections are recursive by default. If non-recursive 
	   behavior is desired then use the '-Nr' option.

ARGUMENTS
     -t<time>
        Bring the selected object's revision into the
        workarea based on the current RSO AND the time specified in 
        the following format <YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS>.
        
    -ccw
        Check consistency of selected objects. This option will 
        check for the existence and permissions of unchanged files 
        in the workarea. You should use this option if you find 
        files missing in your workarea.

    -Nr
        Do NOT recursively descend the directory to populate
        the sub-directories i.e. only populate the files in the
        selected directories.
       
    [select options] pathnames
        These are selection options.
        Refer to help for the 'select' command.

        The selections in the SOS window will change to the
        selection specified by these options.

        If no selection option or pathnames are provided then
        the command will be performed on the current selections
        in the SOS window.
   
EXAMPLES
    soscmd updatesel
        Bring the revisions matching RSO of files selected in
        the SOS window into your workarea.

    soscmd updatesel README
        Apply the current Revision Search Order and get the
        updated revision of 'README' into your workarea.

    soscmd updatesel -sr DOCS_DIR
        Update the entire dir 'DOCS_DIR'. It will
        update the directory and all its children and populate
        any new children added under the DOCS_DIR.
