soscmd definebranch - define/declare new branches
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd definebranch [-d<description>] <branch names>
                        [-a<Attr=Val>]
                        [-mod] [-fbr] [-P<project name>]

DESCRIPTION
    Before you checkout a file on a branch the branch name must 
    be defined or declared. This ensures that you do not 
    accidentally use an incorrect name.

    This command lets you define new branch names.
    
ARGUMENTS
    -d<description>
        Optional description comments to be associated with 
        the new branches to be created.

    -a<Attr=Val>
        You can specify the following 2 attributes.
           IgnoreIfTerm
           Terminated
        Both the attributes can have values "yes" or "no".

    -mod
        Use this option to modify the description of an already
        defined branch. If this option is not present, the branch
        will be defined.

    -fbr
        Use this option to define a "File Branching", meaning file level
        branching is assumed. If this option is not present then
        "Project Branching" is assumed. For Project Branching a Snapshot
        called "BranchName_baseline" is taken with the current state of
        the project in this workarea.
        This option is ignored when -mod is specified.

    -P<project name>
        Define branches for the specified project(s).
        If project name is the special keyword 'All', then
        branches are defined for all projects (primary and reference).
        Multiple '-P' options are allowed.
        If this option is not specified, the branches will be defined
        in the primary project.

    <branch names>
        List of space separated branch names to be created.

NOTES
    Once a branch is defined you can create and checkout files
    on a branch with this name.

    Branches, tags, and snapshots are in the same name space
    and are referred to as 'labels'. So names of branches, 
    tags, and snapshots have to be unique.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd definebranch speedopt
        Define a branch with the name 'speedopt'.

    soscmd definebranch -PAll speedopt
        Define a branch with the name 'speedopt' for the main
        project and all reference projects.

    soscmd definebranch areaopt speedopt poweropt
        Define three branches with the names 'areaopt', 
        'speedopt', and 'poweropt'.

    soscmd definebranch -d"Branch to do area optimizations" areaopt
        Define a branch with the name 'areaopt' with the
        given description.

    soscmd definebranch -mod -d"Optimizations branch" areaopt
        Description of branch name 'areaopt' is modified with the 
        given description.

    soscmd definebranch -mod -aTerminated=yes areaopt
        The branch 'areaopt' is set to be terminated for the
        main project

    soscmd definebranch -mod -aTerminated=no areaopt -PUSB4
        The branch 'areaopt' is set to be unterminated for the
        USB4 project.
