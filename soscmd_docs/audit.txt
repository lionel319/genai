DESCRIPTION
    Displays the audit trail for the project in a chronological
    ascending order.

    The following columns are displayed:
      Date
      Time
      Username
      Command
      Pathname
      Revision
      Change Summary

ARGUMENTS
    -txt | -htm | -csv | -f
        These are mutually exclusive options that define the format
        of the audit trail.
        -txt --> Text output in columns
        -htm --> HTML format with tables
        -csv --> CSV format, tab spaced
        -f   --> Custom format, will print to stdout
                 Delimiter: '%'
                 Valid fields: date, user, cmd, obj, rev, summary
                 Numerical value after delimiter "%" decides field width
                 E.g:  "%20date %-20user %summary %obj %rev %cmd" 

        If no format is specified then -txt is assumed.

    -from<date+time>
        The local date and time from which the audit trail should be
        displayed. The date and time is specified in local time
        and converted appropriately on the server.
        The format for specifying date+time is:
            "YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS"
        You must start with the year but you can choose to
        specify as little as you want. The parts not specified
        will be assumed to be 0.

        You can also specify the number of days before the 
        current date by indicating a negative integer: "-N".

        If this option is not specified then it will default
        to the last time this workarea was updated to bring in
        new files and directories.        

    -to<date+time>
        The local date and time up to which the audit trail should be
        displayed. The date and time is specified in local time
        and converted appropriately on the server.
        The format for specifying date+time is:
            "YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS"
        You must start with the year but you can choose to
        specify as little as you want. The parts not specified
        will be assumed to be 0.

        If this option is not specified then it will default
        to the current time.
    
    -snapfrom<snapshot name>
        The local date and time for the snapshot from which the audit 
        trail should be displayed.

    -snapto<snapshot name>
        The local date and time for the snapshot to which the audit 
        trail should be displayed.

    -cmd<command name> ...
        This option is a filter to specify which commands will 
        be listed in the audit trail. The option can be used
        multiple times to specify multiple commands. The command
        name string should match the command name used with
        soscmd. Only commands that write into the repository are 
        valid options. The following are valid options:
          create, co, ci, discardco, tag, snapshot, delete, rename,
          deleterev, modattr, definetag, definebranch, merge,
          move, termbranch, addreference and editreference

        If this option is not specified then all commands are
        listed.

    -sfo | -sdo
        These are mutually exclusive options that filter the
        audit trail to display either files or directories.

        -sfo --> Display audit trail for files and packages ONLY
        -sdo --> Display audit trail for directories ONLY

        If neither option is specified then the audit trail for
        all objects will be displayed.

    -out<file name>
        Pathname of the output file for the audit trail.
        If a relative pathname is provided then it is assumed
        to be relative to the root of the workarea.

        If this option is not provided then the audit trail is
        created in file (in the root of the workarea directory):
          audit_trail.txt  --> for TEXT output
          audit_trail.html --> for HTML output

    -P<project name>
        Passing either <path name> or <project name> is mandatory.
        But should NOT pass both.

        Get audit trail for the specified project. This can be
        the primary project or a reference project. If this 
        option is not specified, the audit trail will be returned
        for the primary project.
        Multiple '-P' options may NOT be specified.

     <path name>
        Passing either <path name> or <project name> is mandatory.
        But should NOT pass both.

        Get audit trail for the selected path in the given primary project
        using -ixr, will report details included reference projects as well.

        User can select multiple paths
        Results for multiple files will all be displayed in one outfile
        If top level path present, results for child path selection will 
        be present in one top level path

    -ixr
        This option generates audit report for included external references in
        primary project.

        This option is only valid for audit trail based on paths.
         
    -group 
        Will generate high level summary of all the transactions/ operations
        Grouping them based on a given timestamp

    -b<branch name>
        Filter the audit results for a given branch. 
        Multiple '-b' options supported
   
    -user<user_name>
        Filter audit results for the given user. 
        Multiple '-user' options supported 

NOTES
    Even if the server is in a different time zone, all times displayed
    in the audit trail report are in the local time zone.
    -from and -to should also be specified in local time.
