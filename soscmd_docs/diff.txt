----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd diff [-gui] [pathnames]

DESCRIPTION
    Displays the difference between two revisions of the 
    same file.

    You may specify up to two pathnames which refer to two
    revisions of the same file.

    If you specify only one pathname then the second one is
    assumed as follows:
        If the file is checked out then this is used.
        If the file in not checked out then the revision 
          currently in the workarea is used.

ARGUMENTS
    -gui
        If DISPLAY is available, show the differences in a
        dialog box.
        If display is not available or this option is not
        specified the differences are printed to the standard
        output.

    pathnames
        The revisions of a file on which to run the diff
        operation.

        If no pathnames are provided then the command will be 
        performed on the current selections in the SOS window.
	
	Pathnames can be appended with revision or label
	(Tag, Branch or Snapshot) using "/#/" separator.
	Revisions associated with the label will be used in
	diff.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd diff
        Print the difference between the revisions of the file
        selected in the SOS window.

    soscmd diff stimulus.dat/23 stimulus.dat/main
        Compare revision '23' of stimulus.dat with the latest
        revision.

    soscmd diff stimulus.dat/#/23 stimulus.dat/#/main
        Compare revision '23' of stimulus.dat with the latest
        revision. The "/#/" separator can be used to force sos
	to treat the following name as a revision or label.

    soscmd diff Makefile/main
        Compare the latest revision of the 'Makefile' with the
        revision currently in use in the workarea.

    soscmd diff mytest.v
        If 'mytest.v' is checked out then compare the checked
        out (and modified) file with the previous revision.
