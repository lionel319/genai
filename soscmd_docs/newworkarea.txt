soscmd newworkarea - Create a new workarea for an existing project
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd newworkarea server project [pathname] [-l<labelname>]
                       [-L<workarea type>] [-here]
                       [-root<valid directory in the project>] [-P<projname> -l<label1> -l<label2> ... ]

DESCRIPTION
    A new workarea is created with the pathname or current directory
    as the root for the workarea.

ARGUMENTS
    server
        Name of the server to be used.
    
    project
        Name of the project to create a workarea for.

    pathname
        Optional pathname of the directory which will be the
        root of the workarea. If this argument is not specified
        the workarea is created in the current directory.

    -l<labelname>
        Specify the name of the tag, snapshot or branch to be
        used in the revision search order.

        Multiple '-l' options may be specified to create a 
        revision search order consisting of multiple labels.
        The order in which the labels appear on the command 
        line will be the order in which they will be placed
        in the revision search order.

        If the '-l' option is not specified then 'main'
        revision search order will be used.

    -L<workarea type>
        Workarea type can be either CACHED, LOCAL, WRITABLE, or LATEST
        
        If workarea type is CACHED, the files in the new workarea
        are created as links to the cached revisions by the cache server
        in the cache repository.
        
        If workarea type is LOCAL, the files in the new workarea
        are created as full read-only local copies.  Check out is required
        to edit the files.
        
        If workarea type is WRITABLE, the files in the new workarea
        are created as full writable local copies. Check out is not required
        to edit the files.  Merging is required on ci if multiple users
        make changes to the same file. This option is best suited for editing
        text only files and is NOT recommend for working with binary data.
        
        If workarea type is LATEST, the files in the new workarea
        are created as links to the cached revisions in the cache repository 
        and auto update of files and directories is set to immediate.
        
        If this option is not specified, the default will be LOCAL unless a 
        default is defined by an admin in the sosd.cfg.

        LOCAL and WRITABLE are the only options supported on the Windows platform.

    -root<project root>
        Project root argument should be a valid directory existing in the
        project. This option essentially allows the user to create a new
        workarea with a lower level directory as the root provided that
        directory matches the revision search order specified. If the -root
        argument is not specified, it is set as "." which is
        the top root directory of the project. 

    -here
       Create workarea in the 'pathname' directory without checking if
       ancestor is a workarea.
       This option allows creation of a workarea nested under an existing
       workarea, similar to the sos gui option '-here'.

    [-P<projname> -l<label1> -l<label2> ... ]
       This will set the revision search order for the specified project. 
       The -P<projectname> option should be followed by one or more -l<label1>.

NOTES
    This can only be done for a directory which is not an existing
    SOS workarea.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd newworkarea serverPalm cray_yp
        Create a new workarea in the current working directory
        using the server 'serverPalm' and project 'cray_yp'.
        The files are maintained as local copies.

    soscmd newworkarea serverPalm cray_yp ./work
        Create a new workarea in the 'work' directory using the
        server 'serverPalm' and project 'cray_yp'.
        The files are maintained as local copies.

    soscmd newworkarea serverPalm cray_yp -LCACHED
        Create a new workarea in the current working directory
        using the server 'serverPalm' and project 'cray_yp'. The
        files in the workarea will be maintained as links to the 
        cached revisions by the cache server in the cache repository.

    soscmd newworkarea serverPalm cray_yp -root./rtl -lgold -lmain
        Create a new workarea rooted at ./rtl  directory with gold,main
        as the revision search order.

    soscmd newworkarea serverPalm cray_yp -here
        Create a new workarea in the current working directory
        without checking if an ancestor is already a workarea.
        If current directory is a workarea root, then error out.

    soscmd newworkarea serverPalm cray_yp -Pipcat -ldesign_done -lverif_done
        Create a new workarea in the current working directory and for reference
        project ipcat set the revision search order to the labels design_done followed
        by verif_done.
