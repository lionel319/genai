---------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd terminate [-b<branchname>] [-T -unT] [pathnames]

DESCRIPTION
    Terminate/Activate the specified branches on the selected
    files and directories.

    Terminate a branch if no more development is expected to be
    done on the branch or makes a terminated branch active.

ARGUMENTS

    -b<branchname>
        Specify the name of the branch to terminate/activate on the
        pathnames which are mentioned on the commandline.
    
        If specifying paths on the commandline at least one branch
	name must be provided with the terminate command. You may
	use multiple '-b' options.

    -T  -unT
        These are mutually exclusive options. They specify whether
        to terminate or unterminate (activate) the specified branches.

        To unterminate the branch, it should have been terminated
        previously on the file/directory.

        If neither option is specified, default is terminate (-T).

    pathnames
        Refer to help for the 'select' command for more information
        on pathnames.

        The selections in the SOS window will change to these
        pathnames.

        If no pathnames are provided then the command will be
        performed on the current selections in the SOS window.
