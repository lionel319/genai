soscmd definetag - define/declare new tags or modify tags
----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
    soscmd definetag [-aDescription="comment"] [-aTagState="normal|sticky|locked"]
           [-aExport="yes|no"] [-mod] [-P<projectname>] [-aTagAncestor="yes|no"] <tag names>

DESCRIPTION
    Before you tag a revision with a symbolic name the tag name 
    must be defined or declared. This ensures that you do not 
    accidentally use an incorrect name.

    This command lets you define new tag names or modify existing
    tag names.
    
ARGUMENTS
    -aDescription="comment"
        Optional description comments to be associated with 
        the tag to be created or modified.

    -aTagState="normal|sticky|locked"
        Optional attribute TagState to be associated with 
        the tag to be created or modified. If attribute value
        is set to "sticky" then a tag once applied cannot be moved
        by using the tag command. User would have to first backoff
        the tag and then retag. So if admin wants to control
        retagging of sticky tags then they can remove definetag
        and backoff-tag from the MEMBER role.
        Attribute value "locked" can only be specified with -mod option.
        If the value is set to "locked" then the tag cannot be applied to
        any other revision of the same object or to any other object. MEMBER
        role can lock the tag but only admin can unlock a locked tag.
        Locked tags cannot be backed off. 
        Default value if this option is not specified is "normal".

    -aExport="yes|no"
        Optional attribute to indicate whether a true or false 
        attribute is exported for this tag on each object. If set
        to yes, then an attribute called Tag_<tag name> is set to 
        "T" or "" for true and false respectively.  
        Default value if this option is not specified is "no".

    -aTagAncestor="yes|no"
        Optional attribute to make the default tag behavior tag all the way up to the project root.

    -mod
        Argument to specify that a tag is being modified and not
        created. If this argument is not specified it is assumed
        that the tag is to be created.

    -P<project name>
        Define tag for the specified project(s).
        If project name is the special keyword 'All', then
        tags are defined for all projects (primary and reference).
        Multiple '-P' options are allowed.
        If this option is not specified, the tags will be defined
        in the primary project.

    <tag names>
        List of space separated tag names to be created.

NOTES
    Once a tag is defined you can associate this symbolic name
    with any revision of files or directories.

    Tags, branches, and snapshots are in the same name space
    and are referred to as 'labels'. So names of tags, 
    branches, and snapshots have to be unique.

EXAMPLES
    soscmd definetag tested
        Define a tag with the name 'tested'. TagState attribute
        defaults to "normal".

    soscmd definetag -aTagState="sticky" sticky_test
        Define a tag with the name 'sticky_test' and also make it
        a sticky tag.

    soscmd definetag -aTagAncestor="yes" design_done
        Define a tag with the name 'design_done' and also make its default
        tag behavior to tag its ancestor directories all the way up to its project root.
        
    soscmd definetag -aExport=yes export_test
        Define a tag with the name 'export_test' and also make it
        an exportable tag.

    soscmd definetag gold silver bronze
        Define three tags with the names 'gold', 'silver', 
        and 'bronze'.

    soscmd definetag -mod -aDescription="Rev has passed unit tests" 
           unit_tested
        Modify the description of a tag with the name 'unit_tested'
        with the given description.

    soscmd definetag tested -mod aTagState="locked"
        Modify tag 'tested' by making the TagState attribute as "locked".
        This tag cannot be applied to any other object or to any other
        revision of the applied objects until an admin unlocks it by
        modifying the TagState to either "normal" or "sticky".
